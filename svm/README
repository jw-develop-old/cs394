	The file test_svm.py accepts the following command line arguments:

		info - Adds print statements through info_svm.py. I'd recommend using it with 1 or 2 for readability.
		1 - First test, easily linearly seperable with two svms.
		2 - Similar test, but gets 3 svms.
		3 - XOR, demonstrates model failure.
		wine - Uses wine dataset for classification, with '2' values removed.
		[default] - uses iris dataset for classification.

	One observation is that kernel.linear performs poorly for the larger datasets. After some testing, I
